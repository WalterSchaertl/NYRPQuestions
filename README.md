## Background
Many websites that host regents questions are terribly formatted and ugly. 
This project is a subsidiary of NYRP that aids in faster generation of nicely
foramted questions.

## Purpose
Three main goals
1) Download from the New York regents exam website past test
2) Convert those exams and answers to semi-formatted text files
3) A UI that assists the user in turning text into real, formatted questions
4) Turning those questions into JSON blobs and stored media to allow bulk
ingestion into the NYRP website.
